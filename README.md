# Indonesian-Twitter-Emotion-Dataset

This dataset contains 4.403 Indonesian tweets which are labeled into five emotion classes: love, anger, sadness, joy and fear. 

## Data Format
Each line consists of a tweet and its respective emotion label separated by semicolon (,). The first line is a header. For a tweet with coma (,) inside the text, there is an quote (" ") to avoid column separation.  </br>
The tweets in this dataset has been pre-processed using the following criterias:
1. Username mention (@) has been replaced with term *[USERNAME]*
2. URL/hyperlink (http://... or https://...) has been replaced with term *[URL]*
3. Sensitive number, such as phone number, invoice number and courier tracking number has been replaced with term *[SENSITIVE-NO]*  

## Pre-trained Word Embedding
We have trained 1 Millions Indonesian tweets into Word2Vec and FastText vector. Those pre-trained word embedding can be downloaded [here](https://univindonesia-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mei_silviana_office_ui_ac_id/EkwS7R4C2F9FnYHVLvvkmeoBGRpJ3abNa7Lti9ceG2TWFw?e=dRzvmG).
